# RSA Public-Private Key Pair Generator

This repo uses the power of cryptography to generate public-private RSA key pairs of 2048 bits. The 
standard of encoding the public/private keys is ASN as defined by RFC 3447 at https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3447#page-44.
Run the `rsa_implementation/GenerateKeys.java` file to generate the pairs.
